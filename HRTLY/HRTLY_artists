      <p>Slaves are one of the best new bands of 2015 and they are playing at some of the largest festivals in the UK this year including <i>Reading and Leeds, Camp Bestival, The Great Escape</i> and <i>Truck Festival.</i> It is perhaps Slaves’ unique music style which has been described as: <blockquote>British punk with harsh bluesy garage riffs</blockquote> That has attracted so much attention and attraction, which lead to the band being nominated for both NME’s best new band 2015 and the BBC’s sound of 2015 award. More recently Slaves have released their debut album <i>Are You Satisfied?</i> Which reached number 8 during its first week in the UK album charts. Despite some controversy over the band’s name they have continued to produce and perform excellent music and will be a band to look out for in the future.</p>
