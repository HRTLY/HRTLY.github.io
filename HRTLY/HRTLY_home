      <h2>Hanging - Nothing But Thieves</h2><br />
      <h3>Today's New Track:</h3><br />
      <p>This sensational new five-piece have been rocking their way into 2015 with hit after hit, first with "ban all the music" and then next with "itch". Our track of today, from Nothing But Thieves, was decribed as the B-side to their newest single "itch".</p>

      <p>Nothing But Thieves are one of the biggest artists of this year with "Itch"  featuring as a BBC Radio 1 track of the day and a debut album coming in August of this year. Whilst "Hanging" may not have been quite as large as Nothing but Thieves previous' singles (yet), it has been massively enjoyed by fans of the band and is sure to be part of their tour playlist. Hopefully the band will continue to produce amazing records in the near future and we will look forward to their debut album.</p>

      <h2>Slaves</h2><br />
      <h3>Artist of the Week:</h3><br />
      <p>This week’s artist of the week is the UK band Slaves. Formed in Tunbridge Wells, Kent in 2012 the duo have been creating unique music ever since releasing their first EP in 2012. Since then they have released the singles <i>Where’s Your Car Debbie? , Hey</i> and, most recently, <i>The Hunter:</i></p>

    </div>
      <p>Slaves are one of the best new bands of 2015 and they are playing at some of the largest festivals in the UK this year including <i>Reading and Leeds, Camp Bestival, The Great Escape</i> and <i>Truck Festival.</i> It is perhaps Slaves’ unique music style which has been described as: <blockquote>British punk with harsh bluesy garage riffs</blockquote> That has attracted so much attention and attraction, which lead to the band being nominated for both NME’s best new band 2015 and the BBC’s sound of 2015 award. More recently Slaves have released their debut album <i>Are You Satisfied?</i> Which reached number 8 during its first week in the UK album charts. Despite some controversy over the band’s name they have continued to produce and perform excellent music and will be a band to look out for in the future.</p>

      <h2>Sound &#38 Color – Alabama Shakes</h2><br />
      <h3>Album Spotlight:</h3><br />
      <p>Released in April, 2015 Alabama Shakes’ second album was released just over three years after their debut album <i>Boys &#38 Girls</i> features top singles such as <i>Gimme All Your Love </i> and <i> Don’t Wanna Fight:</i></p>

    </div>
      <p>The album was appreciated around the globe reaching number 1 in the US Billboard 200 and number 6 in the UK album charts. Sound &#38 Color demonstrates Alabama Shakes truly unique and mesmerising style that endears the listener to never stop listening, it has also fascinated the critics who have described the album as: <blockquote>deliberately weird record, but authentically weird; it's chaotic yet cohesive, full of sound, colour and unshakable vision</blockquote> Which perfectly describes the beautiful sound that Alabama Shakes creates.</p>
